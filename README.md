# FreeCodeCamp-Random-Quote-Machine-Challenge

This contains a page using html, css and js to generate a random quote from a list of quotes and also contains a daily quote that changes depending on the day you are viewing the page. 

It also allows the user to tweet the random quote on their twitter. The button to tweet the quotes appears after the Get-A-Quote button is clicked.
